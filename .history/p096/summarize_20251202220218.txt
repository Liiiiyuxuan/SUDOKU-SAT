We compared two SAT encodings of Sudoku:
- Minimal encoding: sud2sat
- Extended encoding: sud2sat1

Both encodings were run on the same 50 puzzles from p096/p096_sudoku.txt. All 50 puzzles were satisfiable under both encodings.

1. Encoding Size
----------------

Variables
- Minimal:  average 729.0 variables
- Extended: average 729.0 variables

The choice of encoding does not change the number of Boolean variables, since both encodings represent the same underlying Sudoku model (9×9 grid, 9 possible digits per cell).

Clauses
- Minimal:  average 8829.0 clauses, worst case 8829.0 (Grid 01)
- Extended: average 9092.78 clauses, worst case 9448.0 (Grid 49)

The extended encoding introduces additional clauses. On average, it adds about 264 extra clauses compared to the minimal encoding:
    
    9092.78 - 8829 = 264

This corresponds to roughly a 3% increase in the number of clauses. Thus, the extended encoding is slightly larger, but the difference in size is modest.

Memory Used
- Minimal:  average 5.234, worst case 5.600 (Grid 45)
- Extended: average 5.249, worst case 5.540 (Grid 46)

Memory usage increases only very slightly when moving from the minimal to the extended encoding (around 0.3% on average). In practice, this difference is negligible.

2. Solver Performance
---------------------

CPU Time
- Minimal:  average 0.005, worst case 0.005 (Grid 47)
- Extended: average 0.005, worst case 0.006 (Grid 46)

The average CPU times are essentially identical for these small instances. The small differences in worst-case times are within typical timing noise; both encodings solve all 50 puzzles in roughly the same wall-clock time.

However, internal SAT solver statistics reveal a significant difference in how hard the search is.

Conflicts
- Minimal:  average 8.64 conflicts, worst case 109 (Grid 47)
- Extended: average 0.26 conflicts, worst case 3 (Grid 06)

The extended encoding dramatically reduces the number of conflicts. On average, the extended encoding has about 33 times fewer conflicts than the minimal encoding.

Decisions
- Minimal:  average 17.30 decisions, worst case 157 (Grid 47)
- Extended: average 1.50 decisions, worst case 6 (Grid 06)

The extended encoding also reduces the number of decisions by about a factor of 11.5 on average. This indicates that the solver needs far fewer guesses.

Propagations
- Minimal:  average 949.76 propagations, worst case 4719 (Grid 49)
- Extended: average 741.06 propagations, worst case 936 (Grid 47)

The number of propagations is reduced by roughly 28% when using the extended encoding.

Restarts and Conflict Literals
- Minimal:  average restarts 1.02, worst case 2 (Grid 47)
- Extended: average restarts 1.00, worst case 1 (Grid 01)

- Minimal:  average conflict literals 52.20, worst case 749.00 (Grid 47)
- Extended: average conflict literals 0.54, worst case 9.00 (Grid 50)

Again, the extended encoding causes much less backtracking activity overall.

3. Interpretation
-----------------

The minimal encoding is slightly more compact in terms of clauses, but it provides weaker propagation. As a result, the SAT solver needs more decisions and encounters more conflicts to solve the same puzzles.

The extended encoding adds redundant constraints, increasing the number of clauses by about 3%. These additional constraints significantly strengthen unit propagation. The solver can deduce more information without branching, which leads to:

- far fewer decisions,
- far fewer conflicts,
- and fewer propagations overall.

Even though clause count and memory usage are slightly higher, the extended encoding makes the search substantially easier.

4. Conclusion
-------------

On this benchmark (50 Sudoku puzzles from p096/p096_sudoku.txt), the minimal and extended encodings have the same number of variables and very similar memory usage and CPU time. However, the extended encoding produces a much stronger SAT formulation:

- ~3% more clauses,
- but ~33× fewer conflicts,
- ~11.5× fewer decisions,
- and ~28% fewer propagations.

Therefore, the extended encoding is clearly preferable from a SAT-solving perspective: a small increase in encoding size results in a much simpler search space and significantly reduced search effort.
